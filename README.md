# JSON-Generator
Easy-to-use generator to make the JSON files for primarily resource packs, but also can be used for resource packs.

Tauri version can be viewed from [here](https://github.com/Deviouslrd/json-generator/tree/tauri)
Java rewrite has stopped after a few month hiatus that was enough for tauri to be worth the switch back to. Plus I get the small file sizes i wanted without learning a completely new language and all its quirks.

If you find any issues, they will be dealt with in due time (probably a few months tbh)

## Local Development Fork

To edit this generator for your own purposes, theres just a couple steps.
1. Clone the repo to a local folder (easy to do with the github desktop app, or via cli)
2. Open the repo in your favourite code editor, and open a terminal of sorts.
3. Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies and to acquire the node modules required to run it.
4. Visit [this website](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/intro) for tauri-specific requirements to develop this.
5. When that is finished, run `npm run tauri dev` to get the app running.
6. Enjoy the chaos that is the JSON generator. (I'm not kidding)
